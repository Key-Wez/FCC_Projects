    <!-- Bio -- Intro -->
    <p><strong>Alan Mathison Turing</strong> was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
      philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer
      science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can
      be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical
      computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his
      home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the
      Official Secrets Act. </p>

      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of A.Turring</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
          University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
          the "National Youth Administration"
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
          Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
          Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
          scars on me."
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the
          US Forestry Service
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
          Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
          he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
          breeding pest-resistent plants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
          Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
          his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
          disinfectants, and other applied science.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
          Pathology
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
          leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
          plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
          6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
          different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
          season, doubling wheat yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
          with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
          well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
          strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
          mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
        </li>
        <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li>
          <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
          increase their maize and sorghum yields
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
          A&M University
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
          food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
          only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
          that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
          genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
          before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
